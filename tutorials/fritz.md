# Fritz

[Fritz](https://github.com/fritz-marshal/fritz) is the science data platform for 
the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://ztf.caltech.edu) Phase II.

Fritz integrates and extends two projects, 
[SkyPortal](https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal) & [Kowalski](https://github.com/dmitryduev/kowalski). 
It implements an end-to-end, scalable, API-first system for Time-domain Astronomy featuring:
- A multi-survey data archive and alert broker
- An interactive collaborative marshal for the transient, variable, and Solar system science cases, 
  with fine-grained access control
- A workhorse for machine learning applications and active learning
- Follow-up observation management with robotic and classical facilities

The project documentation is hosted at [https://docs.fritz.science](https://docs.fritz.science).
